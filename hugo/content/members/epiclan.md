## About Us

EPIC.LAN is one of the UK's most exciting LAN gaming events featuring a great range of social games and eSports tournaments. We run LAN parties from 32 players up to 750 around the UK as well as working closely with other gaming industry organisations such as EGX and ESL UK.

The team behind EPIC.LAN has over 10 years of experience delivering gaming events for both social and competitive gamers as well as a wide industry experience. The team are also avid gamers themselves and you will often see them on online servers as well as visiting LAN events worldwide to look at what works best for our home LANs. 

Gaming was our main focus, but as our reputation has grown, we’ve found more and more people wanting to get involved with us to make their activities more epic too.

Whether we’re running an event, developing a software product, looking after marketing or community management needs, running a tournament, setting up a network, or just giving advice, whatever we do, we want to make it **epic**.
